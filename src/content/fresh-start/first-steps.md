# First steps

Apisearch is a easy-to-integrate search engine for your business.

By using our libraries, integration packages and clients you will be able to
boost your website and applications to the next level, introducing predictive 
features, allowing your final users to find what they are looking for in a way 
you never dreamed, and increasing your conversion rate.

You will be able, as well, to manage all your data across several platforms just
by enabling some plugins, to join marketplaces, analyze your users behavior in 
your site in order to take smart decisions, and know your business in a way you
did not expect until now.

```go
import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, 世界")
}
```

Object.defineProperty(typeof global === "object" ? global : window, "PI", {
    value:        3.141593,
    enumerable:   true,
    writable:     false,
    configurable: false
})
```

```php
if (version_compare(phpversion(), '7.1', '>=')) {
    ini_set( 'serialize_precision', -1 );
}
```

```cobol
