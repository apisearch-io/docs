# Api Reference

In this chapter we will expose all the HTTP contract that Apisearch exposes.
Of course, you will always be able to use Apisearch by using the clients, but if
the language you're using does'nt have a client yet, or this one is not enough
good for you, or even if you want to use directly the HTTP layer, then you will
always have this specification.

- [Application](http-reference/application.html)
- [Application](http-reference/index.html)
- [Query](http-reference/query.html)
- [User](http-reference/user.html)
