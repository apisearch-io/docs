# Integrations

## Roadmap

We encourage you to develop your own extensions for Apisearch. Make sure you
understand how our API Works by reading our [Api Client](api-client.html) and
in case you develop something related to the project, please, send us an email
to *hello+docs@puntmig.com* to make sure you have the needed support and our
help.

We have a very clear policy about supported plugins. If you want to develop a
third party plugin, and we consider that the code quality is enough to be
official, then we will offer you part of the benefits earned from these
extensions. So if you're considering one of these scenarios, please, contact us
as soon as possible.

Here you have our integrations roadmap. This is only a guide and is not ordered
by importance. That may have some changes in the future, and as long as they are
implemented, will be added in the integrations list and properly documented.
