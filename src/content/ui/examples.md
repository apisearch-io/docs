# Examples

There are infinite possibilities where Apisearch can be used, even the search
input of this documentation is built on top of Apisearch. Here we'll show some 
use cases.

## API Music

This is a simple aggregator of music albums built entirely with Apisearch to index
and query the data, and ApisearchUI to build the super fast experience. 
> You can play with it on [apisearch.io](http://apisearch.io)! :)
