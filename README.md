# First steps

Welcome to the Apisearch docs.

Apisearch is an easy-to-integrate search engine for your business, specially
tailored for developers and designers, and distributed for all kind of projects,
companies and business segments.

By using our libraries, integration packages and clients you will be able to
boost your website and applications to the next level, introducing predictive 
features, allowing your final users to find what they are looking for in a way 
you never dreamed, and increasing your conversion rate. That's our main goal.

You will be able, as well, to manage all your data across several platforms just
by enabling some plugins, to join marketplaces, analyze your users behavior in 
your site in order to take smart decisions, and know your business in a way you
did not expect until now.

## Is this for me?

If you have searchable entities, then Apisearch is for you. Of course, and as
every project our there, depending on your use case, your integration will be
deeper and more specific, but searching things should be as simple as it sounds.

## How can I start?

Reading how Apisearch is designed is important if you want to understand the
real cost of an integration, so if you need to start digging in Apisearch,
you're lucky today! You're exactly in the best place.

including developers and integrators. Join us in
